# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

This project is designed to use a web browser to serve an interactive dashboard through which to view volunteer's belly button bacteria for the purpose of culturing it for 
synthetic food production.  The dashboard is designed to display the database of types of bacteria present in each volunteer, by their ID number, as well as their frequency of 
washing.
